# BigBang

This is a Python script that generates a list of numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "BIG", multiples of 5 with "BANG", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "BIGBANG". The output is saved to a JSON file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- json module

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script by typing `python BigBang.py` and pressing Enter.
4. The output will be saved to a file named `output.json` in the same directory as the script.

That's it! You should now have a file named `output.json` containing the generated list of numbers.
